    </h2>
    <p>
      There is no new release for the desktop app. I'm still making major changes to the Search system and need more time for review.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Android app is a major release. The major change is a faster search system. To get it, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download the new Android apk: <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/releases/tag/v3.3.1.1" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/releases/tag/v3.3.1.1</a> 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Note: I changed the application ID, so make sure you remove the old XOWA app, or you will have 2 XOWA apps. If you do end up with 2 of them, remove both, and reinstall v3.3.1.1 again
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Download the new core English Wikipedia files (1.6 GB): <a href="https://archive.org/download/Xowa_enwiki_latest/Xowa_enwiki_2016-02-04_html_core_v2.7z" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://archive.org/download/Xowa_enwiki_latest/Xowa_enwiki_2016-02-04_html_core_v2.7z</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Here is a brief summary of the advantages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Better performance: Search is much quicker. One word searches should come back subsecond and multiple words should come back in a few, with initial results coming back in the first second
      </li>
      <li>
        Better ranking: Search now ranks results by <a href="/site/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">page rank</a>. Previously, XOWA ranks by page length, which resulted in long "List of" articles appearing near the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better search terms: Search now handles punctuation better. Searches can be done for "U.S.A." or "USA"; "dont't" or "dont"; "half-life" or "half" or "life".
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I'll explain these in greater detail in the next desktop release.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using the Android beta, I strongly recommend you get this version. The new search is dramatically improved and well worth the effort.
    </p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      Another week, another postponement. My apologies, but I'm usually very cautious when making database changes -- especially since it's pretty important to get things right the first time. I'm going to try for a Thursday release, but may fall back on next Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did upload the new Android English Wikipedia for 2016-02 this week. The new urls are at <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/36#issuecomment-172428070" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/36#issuecomment-172428070</a> .

    </h2>
    <p>
      I'm skipping the release this week also. I've made some good progress with search, and have a prototype that is significantly faster than the existing version. However, it'll take me another week before I add it to Android and probably two weeks before the desktop.
    </p>
    <p>
      I uploaded the image update for English Wikipedia 2016-02 this week. You can grab the latest at <a href="https://archive.org/download/Xowa_enwiki_latest/Xowa_enwiki_2016-02-03_file_v2b.7z" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://archive.org/download/Xowa_enwiki_latest/Xowa_enwiki_2016-02-03_file_v2b.7z</a> My next task is to make these updates easier, but I'm afraid it'll have to wait until I'm done with major Android features. I'm also postponing other image dumps as I just want to focus solely on search and related matters. I'm hoping to resume next week.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am going to upload the HTML for English Wikipedia 2016-02 this week. If you want to try the new search, you should start downloading this version. Once I'm done with search, you'll have to download these two files to have the new upgraded search for Android:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        en.wikipedia.org-core.xowa
      </li>
      <li>
        en.wikipedia.org-xtn.search.core.xowa
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Until then, if you're using the Android beta, please bear with the slow search. Thanks.

      Also, I'm building English Wiki 2016-02 now. I'm still a little behind in wiki dumps and I'll resume this week.

      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_search_not_working">Fix for search not working</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This was a bug that I introduced back in 3.1.1. Title search doesn't work. For example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Earth&amp;fulltext=y">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Earth&amp;fulltext=y</a> .
    </p>
    <p>
      If you've built a wiki with any 3.1.* version, you will have to rebuild it. You can do this with the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Go to [[Help:Wiki maintenance]]
      </li>
      <li>
        Find your wiki and click the "Search" button
      </li>
      <li>
        Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click "Run script"
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can also rebuild the entire wiki.

      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_English_Wiktionary_sections_not_expanding_correctly">Fix for English Wiktionary sections not expanding correctly</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This bug occurs when opening up any English Wiktionary page. Each page will have Translation tables with a "Hide" / "Show" button. The following occurred when viewing these pages (for example: <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/green">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/green</a>)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Table shows up collapsed, but button says "Hide"
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking on "Hide" only changes the button to "Show"
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking on "Show" finally expands the table
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      v3.2.1 now expands these tables by default. Note that you can control the default behavior at [[Help:Options/Wiki HTML]] under Collapsible

      I was planning to improve the Android search version this week, but ended up spending some time on the English Wiki builds as well as underlying database code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm still going to work on this database code this week. My aims are the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add a feature to auto-sync the current English Wikipedia images set (they're around 90 GB)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add some indices to improve performance on the Android search.
      </li>
    </ul>

      For wikis, I'm going to work on French Wiki.

    <p>
      The 2016-01-13 dump had many erros in the reference section due to bugs in Luaj. One of the following would be displayed:

      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_German_Wikipedia_and_extremely_wide_pie_charts">Fix for German Wikipedia and extremely wide pie charts</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I'm extremely thankful for this report at <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/38" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/38</a> There were HTML issues in German Wikipedia because all the wikis rely implicitly on American formatting rules for decimals. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The German Wikipedia page for Hausmannstätten specifies a pie chart with a width (Breite) of 0.9 . See: <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausmannst%C3%A4tten?title=Hausmannst%C3%A4tten&amp;action=edit">https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hausmannst%C3%A4tten&amp;action=edit</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        This value gets multiplied by various numbers in the template. For example: <code>width:{{#expr:18*{{{Breite}}} }}em;</code>. See: <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorlage:Sitzverteilung/?title=Vorlage:Sitzverteilung/&amp;action=edit">https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vorlage:Sitzverteilung/&amp;action=edit</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      XOWA was doing this multiplication using the user's locale.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For US users (like me), <code>18*.9</code> was calculated correctly as <code>16.2</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        For German users though, <code>18*.9</code> was calculated incorrectly as <code>162</code>. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            This was because Java was interpreting the <code>.9</code> using German number-format rules. Since "." is the thousands separator, and "," is the decimal separator, <code>.9</code> became <code>9</code>. For US users, imagine <code>,9</code> becoming <code>9</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      v3.1.5 fixes this issue by asserting that all decimal-parsing is done in the US locale.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="New_PageBanner_extension_for_Wikivoyage">New PageBanner extension for Wikivoyage</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This was an extension introduced by Wikimedia late last year to standardize the display of the image, icons and table of contents at the top of the page. This involved some considerable work on my side (including a Mustache parser), but XOWA now reproduces the same look.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id=".28Android.29_Show_navboxes_and_other_tables">(Android) Show navboxes and other tables</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Wikipedia Mobile app deliberately hides navboxes as well as other tables. I think this is done for the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        These tables were meant for desktop display, and often had wide widths
      </li>
      <li>
        These tables clutter the page.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In contrast, I really do like showing as much content as possible, so I decided to show these tables. I'll probably put an option to disable this later, but I'm going to wait first for some feedback from others
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id=".28Android.29_Always_center_table_content">(Android) Always center table content</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is another deviation from the Wikipedia Mobile app style. Basically most tables are left-aligned and would end before reaching the right-hand side of the page. I changed the CSS to have these tables fill up the entire page and center the content.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has one unfortunate sideback in that it breaks the "Collapse" buttons. I'll try to fix this in a future release, but if I can't, I may remove them entirely.

      <span class="mw-headline" id=".28Android.29_Show_hieroglyphics">(Android) Show hieroglyphics</span>

      Basically, the <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20160113/" rel="nofollow" class="external text">2016-01-13 English Wikipedia dump</a> introduced new page admininistration functions. These include {{PROTECTIONEXPIRY}} as well as a Scribunto function called getStabilitySettings. This resulted in a bold red "Script error" message at the top of every protected page. There are a lot of protected pages.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      In the interim, I hacked in the following approach. Assume a search term of "Earth":
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Search for titles that match the term. For example, "Earth". This is fast and usually comes back in 0 - 3 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Search for titles that have the term in any word within the title. For example, "History of Earth". This is moderate and usually comes back in 5 - 10 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Search for titles that have the term starting in any word within the title. For example, "Earthquake". This is slow and usually takes 15 seconds and sometimes more.

        Fill in the images one by one
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The 2nd stage is necessary because it takes a few tenths of a second to retrieve an image from the database. For large pages (20+ images), this would delay page load by a few seconds (for example: 20 images * .2 second = 4 seconds).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, once a page is viewed, reloading a page shouldn't have to re-retrieve the image from the database. The previous releases were actually re-retrieving the image. This release just uses the image if it's already there.

    <p>
      This only affects a small minority of items that have a colon and spaces in the title. For example, "List of A:B items". XOWA didn't load this page because the underlying Wikipedia Mobile App was encoding the spaces as +.

      I haven't uploaded wikis this week, because I'm working on a blocking item in Wikivoyage (Pagebanner). I'm going to delay another week and focus on updating 2016-01-13 English Wikipedia. This means a new HTML dump which should be available by next Sunday. I'm also hoping to upload the other English wikis, and then continue on to French, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, I'm going to delay the Google Play Store a few weeks. If anyone thinks I should go to Google Play Store earlier, please let me know. From my side, there are a number of items that still need polish. If you have any feedback, please do post in <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/36" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/36</a> I'd appreciate anything: from "Works fine" to "This feature needs some more work".
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, if you have an Android device and want a wiki for your device, let me know which, and I'll bump it up in priority. The next items in queue are French, German, Chinese and Arabic Wikipedia. I'll get to all the wikis but it may take a few months unless I hear requests otherwise.

      The Wikimedia dump service resumed, but I'd like to delay French, Polish and Latin for another week. I'm planning to generate HTML dumps for the rest of the English wikis including Wiktionary, Wikisource, Wikivoyage, etc. This will be a good stress test for the new XOWA html-dump format before I continue on to other wikis.

      I'm also going to continue tweaking the XOWA Android app. If you have a moment to help out with testing, please set it up and give me some feedback: <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/36" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/36</a>

    <p>
      I still have some tasks for XOWA Android that I'd like to work on this week. I am going to try to release the main app next week, but if there are no new changes it may slip again in favor of an update of the XOWA Android release
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven't generated any wikis this week as the dump service seems to have come to a halt. Whenever it resumes, I'll pick up again with the promised updates of French, Polish and Greek

    <h2>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Release:_v3.1.1.1_.282016-01-03_20:00_Sun.29">Release: v3.1.1.1 (2016-01-03 20:00 Sun)</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      v3.1.1 is a minor release. It has a few fixes for some English Wikipedia pages, and many trivial HTML changes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Handle_refs_inside_.7B.7B.23tag.7D.7D">Handle refs inside {{#tag}}</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I only saw this issue on one page in English Wikipedia (United Kingdom), but it has potential for more effects. Basically, XOWA did not handle &lt;ref&gt; inside a {{#tag}}. For example: {{#tag:ref|&lt;ref&gt;a&lt;/ref&gt;}}. For the United Kingdom page, this threw off the format, and made the Infobox as wide as the entire page.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_incorrect_search_word_counts_and_IPA_links">Fix for incorrect search word counts and IPA links</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      There was a minor issue with incorrect search counts for words. I don't think this affects anything for desktop searches, but it did throw off the Android search.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, due to incorrect URL generation, IPA links would not download from the web after being clicked.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Trivial_HTML_changes">Trivial HTML changes</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      v3.1.1 has a bunch of HTML changes to make it slightly closer to MediaWiki's HTML.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The most significant one is the removal of the magnify icon, which is now being handled in CSS as opposed to a separate &lt;img&gt; tag.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are a few other ones affecting incorrect escaping of quotes. This would cause incomplete titles when hovering over images or links.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally there are minor whitespace / attribute generation issues. None of these should be noticeable; they were made to handle log messages during bulk HTML generation
      </li>
    </ul>

      I was on track to release the new Android version tonight, but ran into a last minute issue with thumbs and English Wikipedia. I'm pushing this out another week.
    </p>
    <p>
      For wikis, I'll work on the French Wikipedia refresh, and try to add on Polish and Greek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, an apology to those I've promised minor changes. I've spent a lot of time on Android recently, and there's been a backlog of items. I'm hoping to be done with the Android version in the next few weeks and will work on these items as I get time.

        Poems with references would show duplicate references at the bottom of the page. In addition, the text of the references may be incorrectly placed in the body of the poem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Image maps with scribunto code relying on the page title generated script errors.

      These fixes are several, but the following are notable:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Scribunto code calling json-decode was failing if the code was relying on integer keys. For example, {"1"="a"} needs to parse <code>1</code> as an integer, not a string. Otherwise, code calling <code>ipairs</code> would later fail
      </li>
      <li>
        Mapsource functions such as {{#deg2dd}} would not handle non-ASCII double apostrophes. For example, <code>’’</code> needs to go to <code>''</code> and then to <code>"</code>. XOWA was doing the 1st part (<code>''</code>) but not the second (<code>"</code>)
      </li>

It turned out this fix was not correct, and caused pages in French Wikipedia to have large scrolling sections.

      I reverted the fix for v2.11.4. As it turned out, the issue with extraneous pre sections was handled by the underlying templates themselves.

    <p>
      The simple Category system looks like it broke some time ago during the general database redesign from .sqlite3 to .xowa. I fixed it for this release.

      <span class="mw-headline" id="Next_release:_v2.11.4">Next release: v2.11.4</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I fixed the one minor Wikibase issue, but am deferring a few other possible issues till later. I'm still chugging away on the HTML dump. My aim is to get a simple wiki dump for the next release.
    </p>
    <p>
      I generated the English Wiki dump but there were only about 3 thousand new images, and I didn't feel that it merited an update. For wikis, I'm going to update French, and then go through as many as I can of Lithuanian, Limburgish, Estonian, Latvian and Nynorsk.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Release:_v2.11.2.1_.282015-11-08_22:00_Sun.29">Release: v2.11.2.1 (2015-11-08 22:00 Sun)</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      v2.11.2 is a significant release. It addresses minor, but noticeable issues with gallery sections, location maps, and references. It also has some Wikibase fixes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_Gallery_rendering_vertically_instead_of_horizontally">Fix for Gallery rendering vertically instead of horizontally</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Wikimedia added a change a few weeks ago to force &lt;gallery&gt; tags to use a css. See <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T110709" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T110709</a> This resulted in galleries being shown vertically, instead of horizontally.
    </p>
    <p>
      v2.11.2 now includes this css.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_Location_maps_not_working_on_non-English_wikis">Fix for Location maps not working on non-English wikis</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This has been a bug for a few months, but I had misdiagnosed it as bad Module code. Basically, non-English wikis would copy-paste the same Module:Location_map code in to their wikis. This failed to work in XOWA, because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Module code has a hard-coded reference to <code>Template</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        XOWA actually generates the non-English name for Template for the wiki. For Croatian Wikipedia, this is <code>Šablon</code> not <code>Template</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This basically broke location maps in non-English wikis. I should have caught this earlier, but the first few I looked at were all bad usages (no location coordinates passed).
    </p>
    <p>
      v2.11.2 now uses the canonical name just like MediaWiki.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_extraneous_pre-sections_in_References">Fix for extraneous pre-sections in References</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I think this is also a recent bug, but I can't track down the actual cause. MediaWiki has inconsistent logic for trimming whitespace around template and link arguments. The one at issue was a piece of code like <code>{{TemplateName| B\n }}</code>. On my local version of MediaWiki (1.25.2), it doesn't trim the <code>"\n "</code> after the B and creates a &lt;pre&gt; section. However, on Wikipedia, it does trim the whitespace and does not create a &lt;pre&gt; section.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think this behavior changed recently, but couldn't find the actual line of code in MediaWiki. For now, XOWA will automatically trim end whitespace for all template arguments. In my opinion this is more intuitive behavior anyway.
    </p>

      <span class="mw-headline" id="Minor_Wikibase_fixes">Minor Wikibase fixes</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      These are a handful of signficant fixes that only affect some several dozen pages. They are in brief:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        in Lua code, entity.formatPropertyValues('P123') would not work. Note that entity.formatPropertyValues('property_name') did work
      </li>
      <li>
        Lua code expects a "datatype" property on entity and a value of "globe-coordinate".
      </li>
      <li>
        Lua code required actual numbers for quantity ("99"), not the literal Wikidata value ("+99")
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Minor_fixes_for_Redirect">Minor fixes for Redirect</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      These are two minor items worth more explanation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Redirects would not work if they had an argument. For example, #REDIRECT [[Target_page|link=collapsed]]
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking on "Redirected from" links at the top of the page would not work. For example, try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK</a> and click on "Redirected from UK"
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Minor_JTidy_fix_to_always_enclose_body_text">Minor JTidy fix to always enclose body text</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This was actually not working from the start. Basically tidy needs to take something like ...
    </p>
<pre>
&lt;div class="floatleft"&gt;a&lt;/div&gt;a1&lt;div class="floatleft"&gt;b&lt;/div&gt;b1
</pre>
    <p>
      ... and add some &lt;p&gt; tags to produce ...
    </p>
<pre>
&lt;div class="floatleft"&gt;a&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;a1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="floatleft"&gt;b&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;b1&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
    <p>
      This has a noticeable visual effect for some wikis (Croatian Wiktionary) which have HTML like the above.
    </p>
    <p>
      I modified the jtidy_xowa.jar to handle this behavior.

      I made some good progress with the rewritten HTML dump feature this week, but am still not done. I'm hoping to get ready for v2.11.3 but I need to work on a few other minor issues that have spilled over from this week. (namely in Wikibase).
    </p>
    <p>
      For wikis, I'm generating 2015-11 English Wikipedia. I'm also going to continue through the minor wikis and try to do Slovak, Waray-Waray, Slovanian and Galician

      For code, I'm going to change tack again and table the article update function. I'm working on a different XOWA Android UI with hopes of updating the alpha in the next few weeks.

    <p>
      v2.10.2 is a major release. It has a critical fix for the 2015-10 English Wikipedia dump. It also features better functionality for Chinese / Serbian language wikis. Finally, it also has some significant under-the-hood changes

    <p>
      XOWA was showing broken references on 2.6 millions pages for the 2015-10 English Wikipedia dump. This was due to some recent changes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module:Citation/CS1">Module:Citation/CS1</a>. Specifically, the number of local variables in the citation0 function was greater than the default 200 limit for Luaj.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recompiled a new version of luaj_xowa.jar to fix this issue.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class='mw-headline' id='Language_support_for_Chinese_.2F_Serbian_languages'>Language support for Chinese / Serbian languages</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This item basically involves the following changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Serbian languages now have language dropdowns. For example, sr.wikipedia.org now allows you to switch between Cyrillic and Latin variants
      </li>
      <li>
        Chinese and Serbian wikis now fully implement the "-{}-" syntax. This includes some significant functions like recursive conversion, word-interchangeability, and adhoc rule-definition. See: <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Writing_systems/Syntax">https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Writing_systems/Syntax</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I'm really hoping that the new functionality matches MediaWiki. If you're a Chinese / Serbian user, please take a moment to spot-check a few pages and let me know if there is anything amiss.
    </p>

    <p>
      MediaWiki recently changed the &lt;syntaxhighlight&gt; extension away from geshi to Pygments. In the process, it looks like they changed a few of the general parsing rules as well. v2.10.4 has better support for these blocks, though actual syntax coloring is still some time away.

      XOWA supports custom creation of wikis by matching articles against words. For example, you can create an English Wikipedia that doesn't have any Pokemon articles. Or you can create an English Wikipedia that just has Pokemon articles. The system is intricate but should be quite powerful. For more info, see [[Help:Import/Dansguardian]]

    <p>
      I'm skipping the release this week. I ran into some issues with Chinese / Serbian translations, though I think I'm pretty close to being done. In addition, I have some other significant changes in queue which I didn't want to introduce for a "first-week-of-the-month" release.
    </p>

      If you want a recent stable release, use <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/releases/tag/v2.9.4.1" class="external text" rel="nofollow">v2.9.4.1</a>. I'll keep that release up for a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, next week's v2.10.2 will have more changes. I'll also resume generating wikis from the list below.
