    </h2>
    <p>
      I'm skipping the release this week. I ran into some issues with Chinese / Serbian translations, though I think I'm pretty close to being done. In addition, I have some other significant changes in queue which I didn't want to introduce for a "first-week-of-the-month" release.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want a recent stable release, use <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/releases/tag/v2.9.4.1" class="external text" rel="nofollow">v2.9.4.1</a>. I'll keep that release up for a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, next week's v2.10.2 will have more changes. I'll also resume generating wikis from the list below.
    </p>

      v2.9.4 is a very light release. It has a few minor fixes. Most of my time this week was spent on Chinese / Serbian translation.

      <span class='mw-headline' id='Handle_new_relative_urls_for_CSS'>Handle new relative urls for CSS</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Wikimedia changed their url format for CSS resources this week. Previously it used to be "//simple.wikipedia.org/w/...". Now it is just "/w/..." Unfortunately, since XOWA didn't handle relative-style urls, the CSS files weren't being downloaded for new wikis. This is fixed now.

      <span class='mw-headline' id='Parser_fixes_for_Chinese_wikis'>Parser fixes for Chinese wikis</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      After building the images for the Chinese wikis, I noticed that there were issues with blank message boxes and blank reference text. It turned out that these were broken by the language dropdown back in v2.8.1. I spent a good deal of time fixing these issues, but realized that the current implementation of variant handling (-{zh-hans:text}-) needs to be rewritten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current version is much better than the last version, but there are still some changes that need to be done.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class='mw-headline' id='Minor_source_code_reorganization'>Minor source code reorganization</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I spent a good deal of time reorganizing the main XOWA project codebase. In particular, XOWA had a lot of extra "Source Folders" in addition to "src". These folders arose from the C# to Java conversion and C# having a broader scope for a non-public class than Java (in C#, non-public classes can be seen by classes across namespaces).
    </p>
    <p>
      Source code cleanup is an ongoing process, but this should make a substantial difference.

    </h2>
    <p>
      v2.8.3 is a significant release, but mostly from an infrastructure point-of-view. It has several application startup and deployment changes. It also has an update for English Wikipedia 2015-08-05

      The update itself contains about 157,000 new images. I'm posting v2b tonight and will post v2a and v1 over the next few days. See [[Help:Set up English Wikipedia#File databases: v1, v2a and v2b]]

    </h3>
    <p>
      v2.8.3 has a number of application startup changes. The most noticeable one is a splash animation to show that XOWA is launching after you double-clicked the exe (or ran the sh).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, I added a "fatal error" window to give more information if XOWA fails to run because of SWT or XULRunner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I rebuilt xowa.exe with launch4j. Also, both exe's now support a standalone JRE. If you place a JRE in /xowa/bin/windows/java/jre , it will run on systems without java installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, these changes aren't uniform across all operating systems.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Windows: All of the above apply
      </li>
      <li>
        Linux: Only the first 2 apply. A standalone JRE will probably not happen due to the many varieties of Linux distros as well as the general Linux philosophy of a central package manager
      </li>
      <li>
        Mac OS X: None apply. I had problems with the splash and the error window, whereas I haven't looked at the standalone JRE. I'll work on these for a future release, though it's difficult to say when.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <span class='mw-headline' id='XOWA_home_wiki_is_now_a_sqlite3_database'>XOWA home wiki is now a sqlite3 database</span>

    <p>
      When v0.0.0 was first released, XOWA used text files for all its wikis. XOWA has since moved to sqlite3 databases in v0.7.1 but the home wiki still remained in the text file format.
    </p>
    <p>
      With v2.8.3, the home wiki now is in a sqlite3 format. This should be the start of a number of changes, including better namespaces (everything is in the Help namespace), a functioning Search, image support, and overall better editing. Also, the home wiki will soon be part of the Android Alpha app.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class='mw-headline' id='Cleanup_of_.2Fxowa.2F_root_directory'>Cleanup of /xowa/ root directory</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      v2.8.3 now deploys much fewer files to the /xowa/ root directory. This was done primarily to avoid confusion for new users, as well as general deployment aesthetics. All other files have been moved to elsewhere in the /xowa/bin/xowa/ hierarchy. See the Change Log for more details.
    </p>
    <p>
      For upgrade users, you can ignore these old files in the /xowa/ root directory or clean them up manually. You can also update your app by regenerating the XOWA root directory. See [[Help:Upgrading]] and "Upgrading by an xowa_app package and regenerating the XOWA root directory"

      I was able to get a loaner Windows 8.1, and was able to reproduce the issue. I tried various ways to fix it, but the only thing that worked was upgrading to SWT 4.6M1. I'm hoping it handles the Windows 10 error in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/xowa/discussion/general/thread/652c6303/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/p/xowa/discussion/general/thread/652c6303/</a> as well as other random reports

      While generating the 2015-07 images, I noticed a bunch of minor file issues. They affect something like 5,000 images (out of 4,000,000). These were fixed in this release, and will show up in the next image update

      Packages were delayed again this week. Part of this is related to the erratic <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/xmldatadumps-l/2015-August/001166.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Wikimedia dump server schedule</a>. The other part was due to the file issues found during the English Wikipedia 2015-07 generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was planning to release the 2015-07 update today, but ran across a small issue. In addition, the dumps actually ran early this month, so I'm going to wait a week and release 2015-08 next week. At this point, I'll also regenerate all the other wikis, including Ukraine, Persian, Bengali, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm going to focus more on packages this week, with English Wikipedia being the main priority. If I have time, I'm going to work on the home database as well as Android.

      Unfortunately, I discovered this doesn't work perfectly for Serbian wikis. I'll fix this in a future release, but if you're a Serbian user, you will have to manually use explicit conversion links. For example: sr.wikipedia.org/sr-ec and sr.wikipedia.org/sr-el

      The old version of the Bookmarks page was a simple feature. It basically added bookmarks to the bottom of a wiki page.

      As a result, v2.7.3 now has a new Bookmarks page. These entries get saved in the user database (J:\gplx\xowa\xowa.user.anonymous.sqlite3) . In addition, it supports HTTP Server mode. For more info, see [[Help:Bookmarks]]

    </p>
    <p>
      This will probably become more of a future trend. Future GUI features will appear in Javascript rather than SWT. SWT / XULRunner is sometimes finicky cross-platform, and difficult to debug / reproduce. Meanwhile, GUI features implemented in Javascript can easily be used by the XOWA GUI as well as HTTP Server and Android.

      WMF is currently having problems with the XML data dumps. Unfortunately, it failed in a way to break auto-dump downloading in [[Import Online]].

      First, many thanks again to Mattze96 for the great HTTP server. It's been running fine for a year and a half, and been easy to patch. However, new features were needed for the HTTP server including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Support for POST and other AJAX calls
      </li>
      <li>
        Server-side events
      </li>
      <li>
        More logging
      </li>
      <li>
        Unit testing capabilities
      </li>

      Due to the changes involved, a rewrite of the core was easier and than trying to patch the existing piece. The new HTTP server engine is still a work in progress, but it is stable enough to introduce.

      XOWA had been using 3-year old versions of SWT and XULRunner. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to update due to this SWT bug: <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=429739" class="external text" rel="nofollow">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=429739</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, this was fixed in the SWT 4.5 major release. As such, I've upgraded both SWT and XULRunner. Although this is a major infrastructure change, it will have probably only three noticeable changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Large upgrade packages for 2.6.5</b>: Since I'm re-releasing XULRunner, the upgrade packages will be much larger than normal
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Print button available</b>: This was fixed in SWT 4.3, but I've only been able to include the fix now. See [[Help:Printing]]
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Downloading wikis on some Linux distros won't crash</b>: For some reason, some recent Linux distros started crashing under the old XULRunner 10 when downloading items. XULRunner 17 and up doesn't seem to have this problem. See: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/xowa/tickets/375/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">https://sourceforge.net/p/xowa/tickets/375/</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    </h3>
    <p>
      This was broken during the general database redesign in v2.4.3. XOWA was assuming that v1 image databases would have a format of "fsdb.atr.00.sqlite3". Instead some were "fsdb.atr#00.sqlite3". This only affects image databases from late 2013 and early 2014.

      I had a minor snafu in uploading the English Wikipedia html dumps to archive.org.

      I created a new Special page for helping with general issues. For example, this will list all files in your English Wikipedia directory: <code>home/wiki/Special:XowaDiag?type=fs.check&amp;wiki=en.wikipedia.org</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, it's pretty basic, and will change over the next few releases.

      I'm going to try to keep the next version stable, so I'll probably only work on XOWA droid items. However, I may add a new Bookmarks page for the HTTP server as well as Android.
    </p>
    <p>
      For dumps, a lot depends on the Wikimedia dump servers. I'd like to work on German, but would rather wait for an official "July" version. I'll probably rebuild Spanish and Finnish.

      As per <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/06/12/securing-wikimedia-sites-with-https/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">this blog post</a>, Wikimedia has started moving all traffic to https. Some of this seems to have been implemented during the past week. As a result, XOWA was failing in connections to the Wikimedia servers because it was using http.
    </p>
    <p>
      For v2.6.4, I updated the links to https. Image downloads (and api calls) now work.

    <p>
      This was a long time in coming. The last good build was back in April. The main problem was that the dump server had been offline for all of May. There were also some XOWA issues, and I had to patch the new code to handle v2 as well as v1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Image updates are currently a little confusing. There are currently 2 versions of image databases for English Wikipedia.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        v1: These are ".sqlite" databases in "/xowa/file/en.wikipedia.org/" directory. These were released in 2013-11.
      </li>
      <li>
        v2: These are ".xowa" databases in "/xowa/wiki/en.wikipedia.org/" directory. The databases are about 3 GB each. These were released in 2015-04
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      v1 is obsolete. I needed to make these changes for Android, as well as to simplify future deployments. I will still generate updates for it for the next year, but users are encourage to move over to a v2 series.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class='mw-headline' id='Next_release:_v2.6.5'>Next release: v2.6.5</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I didn't get any of the planned changes done for this week, as both the table of contents and bookmarks were large items. I'm planning to work on them over the next few weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, for v2.6.5, I'm planning to release new versions of SWT and XULRunner. This will bring XOWA a little up to date with recent Mozilla Firefox core changes, as well as take care of other defects (primarily, print page)
    </p>
    <p>
      For wikis, I'm going to upload the English Wikipedia HTML databases, and try to get German going as well.
