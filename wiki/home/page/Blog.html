      The desktop app is a minor release. It has a fix for slow search database builds and some better Wikia support
    </p>
    <p>
      The Android app is a major release. It has new pages for importing a wiki. It is the release candidate for XOWA beta on Google Play later this week.

    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id=".28Desktop.29_Faster_search_database_build">(Desktop) Faster search database build</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      As per <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/53" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/53</a> William was unable to build the new search databases on his machine. I tried it on an older dev machine, and found that it could take upwards of 5 hours to complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      I optimized some of the SQL code and reduced it to about 2 hours. That said, note the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Fails on my 32-bit Windows XP dev machine</b>: I don't know why. The same build works on 2 Windows 7 64-bit machines, 1 openSUSE Linux 64-bit machine, and 1 Mac OS X 64-bit machine. It also works on the 32-bit JVM on the Windows 7 64-bit machine. However, the lone 32-bit Windows machine fails, and fails in a very strange way (it fails silently in release mode, and hangs in debug mode). I'm going to hope this is the non-dominant behavior, and reinvestigate at a later point in time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Really benefits from an SSD</b>: SQLite really does better with an SSD. I tried some tricks like changing PRAGMA synchronous to OFF, but this only shaves off a dozen or so minutes. In contrast, an SSD will easily knock off an hour if not more (from 2 hours to about 40 min)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>If you want the new search, downloading from archive.org is the easiest way</b>: There are other complexities with the search database rebuild (PageRank algorithm and the 10 GB pagelinks dump: See <a href="/xowa/wiki/home/page/App/Search/Overview.html" id="xolnki_2" title="App/Search/Overview" class="xowa-visited">App/Search/Overview</a>).

    </h3>
    <p>
      I uploaded new consolidated versions of English Wikipedia images (2016-03) to archive.org. See <a href="https://archive.org/details/Xowa_enwiki_latest" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://archive.org/details/Xowa_enwiki_latest</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of usage, pick one of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>New user</b>: Download the new 2016-03 version. Previously you would have to download 2015-06 set, and then download separate updates for every month between 2015-07 and 2016-03. This was just too cumbersome.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Existing user (2015-06)</b>: Ignore the 2016-03 version. You downloaded the 2015-06 set and presumably have been keeping up with the monthly updates. The 2016-03 set is the same as your set, except it is smaller (it no longer has deleted images). If you want to remove about 8 GB of deleted images, see <a href="/xowa/wiki/home/page/Dashboard/Files/Deletion.html" id="xolnki_3" title="Dashboard/Files/Deletion" class="xowa-visited">Dashboard/Files/Deletion</a>. Once you remove the deleted images, you will have a set that is exactly the same as the 2016-03 version.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Existing user (2013-11 or something else)</b>: Download the 2016-03 version. You have an old set of XOWA image databases that I really can't support any longer (they have an extension of .sqlite3). I know downloading 80 GB is painful, but I'm not planning to change database formats again in the future.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Finally, after I release XOWA Beta for Android, I'm going to work on a new update feature that will more gracefully handle monthly updates. In the meantime, please bear with the manual process.

      The desktop app is a major release. It has a new autocomplete address bar, a new search system as well as minor parser fixes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Android app is a major release. It has more updates for the new search system.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id=".28Desktop.29_New_autocomplete_address_bar">(Desktop) New autocomplete address bar</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The address bar now supports autocompletion. For example, open up English Wikipedia, and start typing <code>earth</code>. The autocomplete is very fast and supports a lot of advanced functionality. For example you can do a search like <code>earth + (history, future) -middle</code> directly in the address bar. See <a href="/xowa/wiki/home/page/App/Search/Overview.html" id="xolnki_5" title="App/Search/Overview" class="xowa-visited">App/Search/Overview</a> as well as <a href="/xowa/wiki/home/page/Options/Search_suggest.html" id="xolnki_6" title="Options/Search suggest">Options/Search suggest</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the autocomplete uses the new search system, so old wikis need to upgrade the search databases. You can upgrade by any of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use the search suggest box 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Open any page in the wiki
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the search suggest box (the box between "View HTML" and the magnifying glass)
          </li>
          <li>
            Start typing. XOWA will prompt you to upgrade the wiki.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

          <li>
            Find your wiki in the list
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the <code>Search</code> button in the same row

      <span class="mw-headline" id=".28Desktop.29_New_search_system">(Desktop) New search system</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I completely rewrote the search system over the past several weeks. Most of these changes were meant for Android to handle fast searches with a slower processor. This new engine is now part of the desktop app, so desktop users get the same benefits as well. To summarize, here are the main benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Faster searches</b>: Searches are now dramatically faster for single-words (<code>earth</code>), wildcards (<code>e*</code>), multiple words (<code>earth history</code>) and multiple wildcards (<code>earth* history*</code>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>PageRank score</b>: Searches now use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank" rel="nofollow" class="external text">PageRank</a> to order results. These provide better quality results than using page length. The old system would show "List of" pages at the top of the page
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Punctuation friendly</b>: Searches can be done for <code>U.S.A.</code> or <code>USA</code>; <code>dont't</code> or <code>dont</code>; <code>half-life</code> or <code>half</code> or <code>life</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Boolean searches</b>: Searches can use boolean operators like <code>-</code>, <code>,</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>()</code>, and <code>*</code>. In addition, there's even an escape operator: <code>\</code>. See <a href="/xowa/wiki/home/page/App/Search/Overview.html" id="xolnki_9" title="App/Search/Overview" class="xowa-visited">App/Search/Overview</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Home wiki</b>: The home wiki is now searchable. Try entering in <code>search</code> or any other word
      </li>

    <p>
      There are basically two fixes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Category pages had script error</b>: 2016-03 English Wikipedia Category pages would have script errors in the top right corner of the page. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_February_2009" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_February_2009</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Taxonomy boxes would have non-clickable links</b>: 2016-03 English Wikipedia pages on biological species have a taxonomy box at the bottom of the page. It has external links which should be clickable, but were not. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_eagle" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_eagle</a>

      I did upload new updates for English Wikipedia this week. See <a href="https://archive.org/download/Xowa_enwiki_latest" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://archive.org/download/Xowa_enwiki_latest</a> and the 2016-03-05 files. I'll update the links later to point to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll try to upload a new Android release later this week. This will mostly have small tweaks for the new search system.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Release:_v3.3.2.1_.28Andriod_only.29_.282016-03-13_22:00_Sun.29">Release: v3.3.2.1 (Andriod only) (2016-03-13 22:00 Sun)</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Again, there is no new release for the desktop app. I will make one next week, and resume wiki generation then.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Android app is a major release. The major change is an improved search system. To get it, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download the new Android apk: <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/releases/tag/v3.3.2.1" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/releases/tag/v3.3.2.1</a> 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Note: I changed the application ID yet again, so make sure you remove the old XOWA app, or you will have 2 XOWA apps. If you do end up with 2 of them, remove both, and reinstall v3.3.2.1 again
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Download the new core English Wikipedia files (1.2 GB): <a href="https://archive.org/download/Xowa_enwiki_latest/Xowa_enwiki_2016-02-04_html_core_v3.7z" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://archive.org/download/Xowa_enwiki_latest/Xowa_enwiki_2016-02-04_html_core_v3.7z</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Here is a list of the changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "Wikipedia Alpha" updates no longer replaces XOWA: XOWA is a fork of the Wikipedia app. I haven't changed all the Wikipedia branding and IDs. In this particular case, I had left the package name the same. Whenever "Wikipedia Alpha" pushed out a new update, Android would prompt the user to install it. Installing it would remove XOWA and replace it with the "Wikipedia Alpha".
      </li>
      <li>
        Better performance for multi-word searches: I had to add more columns and indexes to support faster lookup for certain types of searches. For example, "earth a". Unfortunately this required updating the core English Wikipedia files again
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not scroll to top of results when adding new results: XOWA works by finding 2 - 5 results at a time and sending them incrementally to the search window. Each send would cause the search results to scroll back to the top. This was annoying when browsing through the list while search is running.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return 10 results by default and scroll to retrieve more results: Previously, XOWA would only return 50 results. Now, XOWA is smart enough to search for more as needed. Also, performance is improved by returning 10 instead of 50.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return search text as first result: XOWA now uses "page rank" to sort the results. However, most times, the search term may not be the highest ranking. For example, searching for "ear" would list "earth" over "ear" because "earth" has a higher rank. Now, XOWA will list "ear" first since that is the current search text
      </li>
      <li>
        Identify redirect articles with "→": Wikipedia uses redirects to handle items like "page renames and "misspellings". For example, "Www" redirects to "World Wide Web". XOWA better identifies these entries by showing "Www → World Wide Web"
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove redundant redirect articles from results: Ordinarily, there can be many redirects leading to the same page. For example, "World wide web" and "World-wide web" are both redirects to "World Wide Web". Previously, searching for "world wide web" would return all three pages. Now only 1 is returned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Search for entire word by putting space at end of search: XOWA automatically adds a wildcard to every search. For example, searching for "earth" actually searches for "earth*" which will return "Earth" and "Earthquake". However, sometimes only "Earth" is wanted, not "Earthquake". Adding a space and searching for "earth " will automatically limit the search to "Earth"
      </li>
      <li>
        Highlight search terms in search results: XOWA was previously relying on Wikipedia code to highlight search terms. This approach was rather simple: it would highlight a term only if the exact search string was found in the text. For example, "Earth History" would correctly highlight "Museum of <strong>Earth History</strong>" but not "History of Earth". This version now highlights the second as "<strong>History</strong> of <strong>Earth</strong>"
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Again, I strongly recommend you get this version. There are a few bugs to work out, but this version is much improved over previous ones. This is the last major update for Android search, and future changes will probably not have as much of a noticeable impact -- at least until I get around to full-text search.
    </p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      There is no new release for the desktop app. I'm still making major changes to the Search system and need more time for review.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Android app is a major release. The major change is a faster search system. To get it, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download the new Android apk: <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/releases/tag/v3.3.1.1" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/releases/tag/v3.3.1.1</a> 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Note: I changed the application ID, so make sure you remove the old XOWA app, or you will have 2 XOWA apps. If you do end up with 2 of them, remove both, and reinstall v3.3.1.1 again
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Download the new core English Wikipedia files (1.6 GB): <a href="https://archive.org/download/Xowa_enwiki_latest/Xowa_enwiki_2016-02-04_html_core_v2.7z" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://archive.org/download/Xowa_enwiki_latest/Xowa_enwiki_2016-02-04_html_core_v2.7z</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Here is a brief summary of the advantages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Better performance: Search is much quicker. One word searches should come back subsecond and multiple words should come back in a few, with initial results coming back in the first second
      </li>
      <li>
        Better ranking: Search now ranks results by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank" rel="nofollow" class="external text">page rank</a>. Previously, XOWA ranks by page length, which resulted in long "List of" articles appearing near the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better search terms: Search now handles punctuation better. Searches can be done for "U.S.A." or "USA"; "don't" or "dont"; "half-life" or "half" or "life".
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I'll explain these in greater detail in the next desktop release.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using the Android beta, I strongly recommend you get this version. The new search is dramatically improved and well worth the effort.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Another week, another postponement. My apologies, but I'm usually very cautious when making database changes -- especially since it's pretty important to get things right the first time. I'm going to try for a Thursday release, but may fall back on next Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did upload the new Android English Wikipedia for 2016-02 this week. The new urls are at <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/36#issuecomment-172428070" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/36#issuecomment-172428070</a> .

    </h2>
    <p>
      I'm skipping the release this week also. I've made some good progress with search, and have a prototype that is significantly faster than the existing version. However, it'll take me another week before I add it to Android and probably two weeks before the desktop.
    </p>
    <p>
      I uploaded the image update for English Wikipedia 2016-02 this week. You can grab the latest at <a href="https://archive.org/download/Xowa_enwiki_latest/Xowa_enwiki_2016-02-03_file_v2b.7z" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://archive.org/download/Xowa_enwiki_latest/Xowa_enwiki_2016-02-03_file_v2b.7z</a> My next task is to make these updates easier, but I'm afraid it'll have to wait until I'm done with major Android features. I'm also postponing other image dumps as I just want to focus solely on search and related matters. I'm hoping to resume next week.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am going to upload the HTML for English Wikipedia 2016-02 this week. If you want to try the new search, you should start downloading this version. Once I'm done with search, you'll have to download these two files to have the new upgraded search for Android:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        en.wikipedia.org-core.xowa
      </li>
      <li>
        en.wikipedia.org-xtn.search.core.xowa
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Until then, if you're using the Android beta, please bear with the slow search. Thanks.

      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_search_not_working">Fix for search not working</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This was a bug that I introduced back in 3.1.1. Title search doesn't work. For example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Earth&amp;fulltext=y" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Earth&amp;fulltext=y</a> .
    </p>
    <p>
      If you've built a wiki with any 3.1.* version, you will have to rebuild it. You can do this with the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Go to <a href="/xowa/wiki/home/page/Dashboard/Wiki_maintenance.html" id="xolnki_10" title="Dashboard/Wiki maintenance" class="xowa-visited">Dashboard/Wiki_maintenance</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Find your wiki and click the "Search" button
      </li>
      <li>
        Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click "Run script"
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can also rebuild the entire wiki.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_English_Wiktionary_sections_not_expanding_correctly">Fix for English Wiktionary sections not expanding correctly</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This bug occurs when opening up any English Wiktionary page. Each page will have Translation tables with a "Hide" / "Show" button. The following occurred when viewing these pages (for example: <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/green" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/green</a>)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Table shows up collapsed, but button says "Hide"
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking on "Hide" only changes the button to "Show"
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking on "Show" finally expands the table
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      v3.2.1 now expands these tables by default. Note that you can control the default behavior at <a href="/xowa/wiki/home/page/Options/Wiki_HTML.html" id="xolnki_11" title="Options/Wiki HTML" class="xowa-visited">Options/Wiki_HTML</a> under Collapsible

      I was planning to improve the Android search version this week, but ended up spending some time on the English Wiki builds as well as underlying database code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm still going to work on this database code this week. My aims are the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add a feature to auto-sync the current English Wikipedia images set (they're around 90 GB)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add some indices to improve performance on the Android search.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For wikis, I'm going to work on French Wiki.

    <p>
      The desktop app is a major release. It resolves reference errors in 2016-01 English Wikipedia, fixes wide images on German Wikipedia, and adds a new PageBanner extension
    </p>
    <p>
      The Android app is also a major release. It shows more tables, heiroglyphics, and images with a ? in title.

      The 2016-01-13 dump had many erros in the reference section due to bugs in Luaj. One of the following would be displayed:

      These were bugs in Luaj with the frontier pattern and multi-byte chars. They were both resolved in this release.

    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_German_Wikipedia_and_extremely_wide_pie_charts">Fix for German Wikipedia and extremely wide pie charts</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I'm extremely thankful for this report at <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/38" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/38</a> There were HTML issues in German Wikipedia because all the wikis rely implicitly on American formatting rules for decimals. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The German Wikipedia page for Hausmannstätten specifies a pie chart with a width (Breite) of 0.9 . See: <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hausmannst%C3%A4tten&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hausmannst%C3%A4tten&amp;action=edit</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        This value gets multiplied by various numbers in the template. For example: <code>width:{{#expr:18*{{{Breite}}} }}em;</code>. See: <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vorlage:Sitzverteilung/&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vorlage:Sitzverteilung/&amp;action=edit</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      XOWA was doing this multiplication using the user's locale.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For US users (like me), <code>18*.9</code> was calculated correctly as <code>16.2</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        For German users though, <code>18*.9</code> was calculated incorrectly as <code>162</code>. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            This was because Java was interpreting the <code>.9</code> using German number-format rules. Since "." is the thousands separator, and "," is the decimal separator, <code>.9</code> became <code>9</code>. For US users, imagine <code>,9</code> becoming <code>9</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      v3.1.5 fixes this issue by asserting that all decimal-parsing is done in the US locale.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="New_PageBanner_extension_for_Wikivoyage">New PageBanner extension for Wikivoyage</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This was an extension introduced by Wikimedia late last year to standardize the display of the image, icons and table of contents at the top of the page. This involved some considerable work on my side (including a Mustache parser), but XOWA now reproduces the same look.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id=".28Android.29_Show_navboxes_and_other_tables">(Android) Show navboxes and other tables</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Wikipedia Mobile app deliberately hides navboxes as well as other tables. I think this is done for the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        These tables were meant for desktop display, and often had wide widths
      </li>
      <li>
        These tables clutter the page.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In contrast, I really do like showing as much content as possible, so I decided to show these tables. I'll probably put an option to disable this later, but I'm going to wait first for some feedback from others
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id=".28Android.29_Always_center_table_content">(Android) Always center table content</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is another deviation from the Wikipedia Mobile app style. Basically most tables are left-aligned and would end before reaching the right-hand side of the page. I changed the CSS to have these tables fill up the entire page and center the content.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has one unfortunate sideback in that it breaks the "Collapse" buttons. I'll try to fix this in a future release, but if I can't, I may remove them entirely.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id=".28Android.29_Show_hieroglyphics">(Android) Show hieroglyphics</span>

    <p>
      The early versions of the XOWA Android app did not show hieroglyphics. This is now supported in this build

      This is an interim release for the desktop app. It fixes script error messages in 2016-01-13 English Wikipedia

    <p>
      I accidentally had the wrong dump in place when kicking off the 2016-01-13 build. As such, I didn't spot the issue till this morning after I restarted the build.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically, the <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20160113/" rel="nofollow" class="external text">2016-01-13 English Wikipedia dump</a> introduced new page admininistration functions. These include {{PROTECTIONEXPIRY}} as well as a Scribunto function called getStabilitySettings. This resulted in a bold red "Script error" message at the top of every protected page. There are a lot of protected pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      v3.1.4.2 resolves both issues. So far, it's stable across 35,000+ pages, but if you run across any issues, please report them. Thanks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The desktop app is a major release. It resolves several wiktionary errors on non-English pages and has better HTML dump generation for other wikis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Android app is a major release. It has a more responsive search, instant image loading when reloading page, and a fix for pages failing to load if they have spaces and colons in the title.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Scribunto_.2F_Luaj_fixes_for_English_Wiktionary">Scribunto / Luaj fixes for English Wiktionary</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      There were several dozen pages with script errors in English Wiktionary. They basically fell into these categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Luaj / Scribunto errors with MCBS entities in Asian languages (1 glyph; 2 char).
      </li>
      <li>
        Programmatic errors for minor cases 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Recursive gsub calls with lua function
          </li>
          <li>
            Search position returned as int not string
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The build log for English Wiktionary looks a lot cleaner now, though I still have to add some support for the {{categorytree}} function.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Better_HTML_dump_generation_for_English_Wiktionary.2C_Wikisource.2C_Wikiquote.2C_etc._Also.2C_French_Wikipedia">Better HTML dump generation for English Wiktionary, Wikisource, Wikiquote, etc. Also, French Wikipedia</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I ran the HTML dump generator through all the English wikis, as well as French Wikipedia. The results looked good, but there were a lot of log errors that were addressed with this release.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id=".28Android.29_More_responsive_search">(Android) More responsive search</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Search is still slow on Android. I'll fix this in a future relase, but I'll have to change the format of the search databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the interim, I hacked in the following approach. Assume a search term of "Earth":
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Search for titles that match the term. For example, "Earth". This is fast and usually comes back in 0 - 3 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Search for titles that have the term in any word within the title. For example, "History of Earth". This is moderate and usually comes back in 5 - 10 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Search for titles that have the term starting in any word within the title. For example, "Earthquake". This is slow and usually takes 15 seconds and sometimes more.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id=".28Android.29_Instant_image_loading_when_reloading_page">(Android) Instant image loading when reloading page</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      First, some background. XOWA loads pages in two stages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Show the HTML
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill in the images one by one
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The 2nd stage is necessary because it takes a few tenths of a second to retrieve an image from the database. For large pages (20+ images), this would delay page load by a few seconds (for example: 20 images * .2 second = 4 seconds).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, once a page is viewed, reloading a page shouldn't have to re-retrieve the image from the database. The previous releases were actually re-retrieving the image. This release just uses the image if it's already there.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id=".28Android.29_Fix_for_pages_failing_to_load_if_they_have_spaces_and_colons_in_the_title">(Android) Fix for pages failing to load if they have spaces and colons in the title</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This only affects a small minority of items that have a colon and spaces in the title. For example, "List of A:B items". XOWA didn't load this page because the underlying Wikipedia Mobile App was encoding the spaces as +.
    </p>

    <p>
      I haven't uploaded wikis this week, because I'm working on a blocking item in Wikivoyage (Pagebanner). I'm going to delay another week and focus on updating 2016-01-13 English Wikipedia. This means a new HTML dump which should be available by next Sunday. I'm also hoping to upload the other English wikis, and then continue on to French, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, I'm going to delay the Google Play Store a few weeks. If anyone thinks I should go to Google Play Store earlier, please let me know. From my side, there are a number of items that still need polish. If you have any feedback, please do post in <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/36" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/36</a> I'd appreciate anything: from "Works fine" to "This feature needs some more work".
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, if you have an Android device and want a wiki for your device, let me know which, and I'll bump it up in priority. The next items in queue are French, German, Chinese and Arabic Wikipedia. I'll get to all the wikis but it may take a few months unless I hear requests otherwise.

      The desktop app is a trivial release. Its main feature is a help page for generating HTML-dumps
    </p>
    <p>
      The Android app is a major release. It has a Random feature, shows more images, and adds CSS-tweaks.

    <p>
      This item is self-explanatory. The XOWA Android app is getting more stable, so I felt it would be time to document the generation of the HTML databases.

      This build has a number of new features.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Random now works in offline mode.
      </li>
      <li>
        All thumb and gallery images should now show up. (approximately 5% of them weren't before)
      </li>
      <li>
        CSS tweaks were added to center the images as well as standardize some background colors

      The Wikimedia dump service resumed, but I'd like to delay French, Polish and Latin for another week. I'm planning to generate HTML dumps for the rest of the English wikis including Wiktionary, Wikisource, Wikivoyage, etc. This will be a good stress test for the new XOWA html-dump format before I continue on to other wikis.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also going to continue tweaking the XOWA Android app. If you have a moment to help out with testing, please set it up and give me some feedback: <a href="https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/36" rel="nofollow" class="external free">https://github.com/gnosygnu/xowa/issues/36</a>

      There's no release for the XOWA app tonight. I've spent the week mostly on the Android app, and there were no real changes for the main desktop app.

    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Next_release:_v3.1.3">Next release: v3.1.3</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I still have some tasks for XOWA Android that I'd like to work on this week. I am going to try to release the main app next week, but if there are no new changes it may slip again in favor of an update of the XOWA Android release
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven't generated any wikis this week as the dump service seems to have come to a halt. Whenever it resumes, I'll pick up again with the promised updates of French, Polish and Greek
    </p>
    <h2>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Release:_v3.1.1.1_.282016-01-03_20:00_Sun.29">Release: v3.1.1.1 (2016-01-03 20:00 Sun)</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      v3.1.1 is a minor release. It has a few fixes for some English Wikipedia pages, and many trivial HTML changes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Handle_refs_inside_.7B.7B.23tag.7D.7D">Handle refs inside {{#tag}}</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I only saw this issue on one page in English Wikipedia (United Kingdom), but it has potential for more effects. Basically, XOWA did not handle &lt;ref&gt; inside a {{#tag}}. For example: {{#tag:ref|&lt;ref&gt;a&lt;/ref&gt;}}. For the United Kingdom page, this threw off the format, and made the Infobox as wide as the entire page.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Fix_for_incorrect_search_word_counts_and_IPA_links">Fix for incorrect search word counts and IPA links</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      There was a minor issue with incorrect search counts for words. I don't think this affects anything for desktop searches, but it did throw off the Android search.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, due to incorrect URL generation, IPA links would not download from the web after being clicked.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Trivial_HTML_changes">Trivial HTML changes</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      v3.1.1 has a bunch of HTML changes to make it slightly closer to MediaWiki's HTML.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The most significant one is the removal of the magnify icon, which is now being handled in CSS as opposed to a separate &lt;img&gt; tag.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are a few other ones affecting incorrect escaping of quotes. This would cause incomplete titles when hovering over images or links.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally there are minor whitespace / attribute generation issues. None of these should be noticeable; they were made to handle log messages during bulk HTML generation
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <span class="mw-headline" id="Next_release:_v3.1.2">Next release: v3.1.2</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I was on track to release the new Android version tonight, but ran into a last minute issue with thumbs and English Wikipedia. I'm pushing this out another week.
    </p>
    <p>
      For wikis, I'll work on the French Wikipedia refresh, and try to add on Polish and Greek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, an apology to those I've promised minor changes. I've spent a lot of time on Android recently, and there's been a backlog of items. I'm hoping to be done with the Android version in the next few weeks and will work on these items as I get time.
